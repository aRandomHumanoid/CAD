# Tools
these are some tools I use for common parts, or custom versions of common parts. Much credit to my robotics team (FRC 125) for source!

- Belt Calc: calculates belt lengths 
- Involute Gear gen: exactly what the title says: generates herringbone/straight involute profiles given #ofTeeth and pitch
- Sproket gen: geneates sprockets for standard chain sizes
- Bevel Gear gen: same as Gear gen, but for bevel gears (a lil unstable)
- Pulley gen: generates pulleys
